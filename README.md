For assignment 1 I had to wrap my initial with a gradient in a function that will tell it to draw a whole row for me instead of having to create the squares individually
For assignment 2 we had to make our own custom shape. I decide to make a tri-force which consists of three triangles.

For assignment 3 I had to make my tri-force re-positionable so I used a translate function to center the shape in the middle of the canvas and I used a scale function to resize it.

For assignment 4 we had to take two flags of our choosing from two different countries and combine them to create out own.
